            Van Gogh returned to Etten in April 1881 for an extended stay with his parents. He continued to draw,
            often using his neighbors as subjects. In August 1881, his recently widowed cousin, Cornelia Vos-Stricker,
            daughter of his mother's older sister arrived for a visit.
